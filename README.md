# Electronic Vault using the industry standard PC/104 embedded system

## Description:

- This electronic safe offers some great features such as a 4 digit key. The 4 digit
  key is gathered from a array with the help of pointers.
  It also has a anti theft system where when the 4 digit pin has been miskeyed for
  3 times it goes into a 10 seconds lockdown mode and sounds off the alarm for
  the next 10 seconds until the lockdown ends.

- Opening vault screens and closing vault screens act as a visual indicator to show
  the status of the vault door.

- A account balance screen is showed to the user so that they be able to decide
  whether to withdraw or deposit. After the transactions have occurred, the
  account balance screen is shown again to confirm the transaction.

- The system consists of a PC/104 Single Board Computer (SBC), LCD panel, keypad and
  buzzer.

- The goals of the system are user-friendly inputs, well guided LCD interface, vivid
  graphics and ease of use.

- The constraints of the system are, water-proofing, power supply and unit
  component cost.
